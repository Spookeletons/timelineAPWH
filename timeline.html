            <h2 id="first2" class="hidden text center">Overview of 1200 to 1450</h2>
            <p>Between 1200 and 1450, many of the foundations of modern life formed (though various developments mean they look quite different today). Interregional trade was popularized through several successful trade routes, and these routes also acted as vectors for cultural diffusion. Technological developments in transportation and navigation facilitated such trade. Religions grew and adapted, often experiencing rifts that led to competing sects.  </p>

            <p>The period from 1450 to 1750 saw a shift toward maritime trade. Accompanying this was a rise in imperialism as European exploration (aided by the continued advancement of transportation technology) brought Europe into contact with the Americas. Through exploitation, Europe gained great wealth and power, even (arguably) eclipsing Asia. Rationales for unjust systems formed, and versions of these rationales sadly stuck around well after the end of this period.  </p>

            <h2 id="third2" class="hidden text center">Overview of 1750-1900</h2>
            <p>The main identifier of the period from 1750 to 1900 is early industrialization. Factories became commonplace, and engines were innovated and developed. Imperialism continued, and as revolutions freed the Americas from the confines of colonialism, Europe shifted their focus to Africa and Asia. A competition known as the Scramble for Africa ensued, and multinational corporations worked with governments to colonize as much territory as they could. This was, of course, at the expense of the people living in these places. Horrifying conditions continued throughout the period, but Europe’s power declined a bit in the late 19th century. Economic imperialism was practiced on countries like China, which were too powerful to be taken over politically, but which weren’t anywhere near as industrialized as Europe. However, Japan’s Meiji Restoration made it equivalent in size and strength to many European empires, and it joined the pack by conquering nearby territories.  </p>

            <p>Between 1900 and the present, the world globalized and modernized. Even better transportation emerged, and communication jumped forward with radio, television, new and quickly improving phones, which eventually became the mobile devices we know and love today, along with other advancements. Globalization has had both pros and cons. It has let many marginalized groups gain stronger voices and thereby get more of the rights they deserve, but it has also enabled neo imperialism. Increased interconnectedness contributed to the World Wars and the Cold War but has since been key in preventing conflict. Now is the safest time in human history to live, but all sorts of new dangers have spawned, and humanity must unite to deal with the plethora of issues that still plague us and that will develop in the coming decades. </p>

            <p>Nomadic tribes in Mongolia were in conflict before 1206. After a series of deaths and events,
                a man whose father was a former tribe leader came to lead. Genghis Khan united all Mongolian tribes,
                forming a single Mongolian nation.
                Genghis led his army, which consisted almost solely of cavalry armed with crossbows, across many thousands of miles of terrain,
                conquering all that fell upon his eyes. He created the geographically largest country of all time, and the balance of power was
                changed for centuries and, in some ways, permanently altered.
                <br><br>
                Marco Polo traveled to Southeast Asia and China repeatedly. Polo was an explorer from Venice, Italy whose claim to fame
                was the aforementioned series of journeys. He left for Asia in 1271
                with his father and uncle. They travelled over the Silk Roads, which were all under Mongol rule at the time, and continued
                until they reached their destination: China.
                During Polo's travels, he kept a book of all his findings and experiences. When he arrived in China, he met Kublai Khan,
                a grandson of Genghis Khan. Polo served on his court in China for a while before returning to Europe.
                Europeans were shocked, but excited, upon hearing the news, and consequently trade between Europe and eastern parts of Asia
                increased.

                The Bubonic Plague, also known as the Black Plague, spread through the whole of Afro-Eurasia, ravaging many regions and populations,
                especially Western Europe. Its spread was facilitated by the increased intercontinental connectedness through trade routes.
                The disease was associated with swelling lymph nodes, high fever, terrible headaches, and internal bleeding below the skin.
                It had a high death rate, and victims usually died within a few days of having it. It is estimated that
                half of Europe’s population perished during the
                initial outbreak from 1348 to 1350. This plague led to other issues, including labor shortage.
                This, however, also had a positive impact: the resulting peasant revolts against serfdom and strikes resulted in higher wages for the
                proletariat.</p>

            <p>The Song Dynasty (960-1276) was an imperial dynasty of China that began in 960 and lasted until 1279. It was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song. The dynasty was divided into two periods: Northern Song and Southern Song. During the Northern Song, the capital was in the northern city of Bianjing and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China. Science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished during the Song era. The Song dynasty was the first to issue banknotes or true paper money and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty saw the first recorded chemical formula of gunpowder, the invention of gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows, fire lance, and bombs. Economically, the Song dynasty was unparalleled with a gross domestic product three times larger than Europe’s during the 12th century. As China’s population doubled in size between the 10th and 11th centuries, the growth was made possible by expanded rice cultivation. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. Women were on a lower social tier than men, but they still enjoyed many social and legal privileges. Religion in China during this period had a huge effect on people’s lives, beliefs, and daily activities. Buddhism flourished in the Song dynasty along with religious Daoism and Neo-Confucianism. With many ethnic foreigners travelling to China for trade or to live there, many foreign religions came with it. This included Middle Eastern Muslims, the Kaifeng Jews, and Persian Manichaeans.
            <br><br>
                The Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) was founded by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. The Yuan Dynasty was preceded by the Song Dynasty from 960 to 1279 and followed by the Ming dynasty which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The Yuan dynasty was established by ethnic Mongols, and it had nominal control over the entire Mongol Empire however, the Mongol rulers in Asia were only interested in China. The Yuan period was one of high cultural achievements, including developments in the Chinese novel and plays with increased use of the written vernacular. A rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty. The major cultural achievements developed were drama, the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular. Given the unified rule of central Asia, trade between East and West flourished. Western musical instruments were also introduced to enrich the Chinese performing arts. Yuan emperors needed regular and reliable tax collection in order to fund their projects around China. This caused some problems between people and their lives. Under the Yuan, the Grand Canal was extended to link Beijing directly with Hangzhou, cutting 700 kilometers from the length of that journey. This however was affected as Mongol rule began to fail in China which resulted into the canal once again being deteriorated.

                The Mongol empire (1206-1368) was the empire founded by Genghis Khan. The Mongols were pastoral nomads of the Asian steppe who herded sheep, goats, horses, camels, and yaks. These tribes moved according to the seasons and lived in temporary camps of circular felt tents or yurts. At its peak, it covered about 9 million square miles of territory, making it the largest land empire in world history. The amazing military achievements of the Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successors were due to superior strategy and tactics rather than numerical strength. Mongol armies were chiefly composed of cavalry which afforded them a high degree of mobility and speed. In battle, they relied mainly on bows and arrows and resorted to man-to-man fighting only after having disorganized the enemy’s ranks. Mongol armaments and tactics were more suited to open plains and flat countries than to mountainous and wooded regions. It expanded to cover most of Eurasia due to advanced technology and the nomadic warriors. They also adopted from the people they conquered. Genghis had decided that his empire was to be divided amongst his four sons Jochi, Chagatai, Tolui, and Ogedei, with each ruling a khanate. Ogedei became the new Great Khan in 1229 to 1241 which made him the ruler of all the Mongols.

                The Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258) was the third caliphate to succeed from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was founded by a dynasty descended from the prophet's uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib, which is where the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE. The Abbasid Caliphate first centered its government in Kufa, modern-day Iraq, but in 762, the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient Babylonian capital city of Babylon. Baghdad became the center of science, culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam. Persian customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite. The Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab mawali and Persian bureaucrats. The status and treatment of Jews, Christians, and non-Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate was a complex and continually changing issue. Non-Muslims were called dhimmis and did not have all the privileges that Muslims had and commonly had to pay jizya, a tax for not being a Muslim. One of the common aspects of the treatment of the dhimmis is that their treatment depended on who the Caliph was at the time. Some Abbasid rulers, like Al-Mutawakkil (822–861 CE) imposed strict restrictions on what dhimmis could wear in public, often yellow garments that distinguished them from Muslims. Other restrictions Al-Mutawakkil imposed included limiting the role of the dhimmis in government. This affected them by seizing dhimmi housing and made it harder for dhimmis to become educated. Although, most other Abbasid caliphs were not as strict as Al-Mutawakkil. During the time Al-Mansur ruled, it was common for Jews and Christians to influence the overall culture in the Caliphate, specifically in Baghdad. Jews and Christians did this by participating in scholarly work and Christians even influenced Islamic funeral service traditions. The Abbasids tried to distinguish themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children, many of whom had been dependents or members of the defeated Sassanian upper classes.

                The Byzantine Empire (330-1453) was a vast and powerful civilization founded well before 1200 by the Roman emperor Constantine. The Byzantine Empire was the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which survived for a thousand years after the western half had crumbled into various feudal kingdoms and fell to Ottoman Turkish onslaughts in 1453. The Byzantine government followed the patterns established in imperial Rome. The emperor was all-powerful but was still expected to consult such important bodies as the Senate. The Senate in Constantinople, unlike in Rome, was composed of men who had risen through the ranks of the military service, and so there was no senatorial class as such. Without elections, Byzantine senators, ministers, and local councilors largely acquired their position through imperial patronage or because of their status as large landowners. Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. The geographical extent of the Byzantine Empire changed over the centuries as the military successes and failures of individual emperors fluctuated. As the Roman army conquered many territories covering the Mediterranean region and coastal regions in southwestern Europe and North Africa, these territories were home to many cultural groups, both urban populations, and rural populations which brought in many new cultures and ideas.

            <p>Religion was key to society in the period from 1200 to 1450. In China under the Song Dynasty, Confucianism was paired with religious
                beliefs to create a powerful social system. Filial piety, the admiration of and submission to the elderly, and other forms of respect
                were central to society in Song China. Islam strongly encouraged trade, and because religions primarily spread over long distances
                through trade, Islam naturally became highly popular throughout Afro-Eurasia. Buddhism spread successfully through trade and travel,
                in part because it could be coupled with other religions. Hinduism’s popularity in South, Southeast, and East Asia was due to India’s
                size and importance in the Indian Ocean Trade Network. Christianity had a significant number of followers, but the decline of the
                Byzantine Empire and the abysmal state of feudal Europe meant that it was limited in significance on a large scale. <br><br> During
                this period, Europe was ruled through the feudal system. The feudal system consisted largely of hereditary hierarchy, and in it four
                classes of people existed: monarchs, nobles, knights, and serfs. Monarchs owned land, which they rented to nobles for management. In
                turn, nobles hired knights for protection. Serfs were unpaid agricultural laborers whose lives were controlled by those in charge. They
                had to pay their lords with some of the crops they harvested, and in return they normally got nothing other than the right to live and
                work on the land. The feudal system initially gave great power to kings, but the balance switched to favor nobles with the signing of
                the Magna Carta and other events. Eventually, though, monarchs returned to power and were back stronger than ever before, and a few
                societies grew into countries that later became European empires. <br><br> Trade networks were key to life and advancement in the period
                from 1200 to 1450. There were three major trade networks connecting Afro-Eurasia at that time: the Silk Road, the Indian Ocean Trade
                Network, and the Trans-Saharan Trade Network. The Silk Road stretched from China to Europe, and it was a land route that saw several
                points of exchange for goods to take them the entire distance. The Silk Road peaked under the Mongol Empire, which controlled a vast
                expanse of land and strongly encouraged trade and technological advancement.
                The Indian Ocean Trade Network was a set of maritime trade routes that connected East Africa, India, Southeast Asia,
                and East Asia. The Trans-Saharan Trade Network went across the Sahara, connecting North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. However,
                because the journey was tough to make, exclusively luxury goods were transported for trade. </p>

                The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644 A.D., during which China’s population doubled. The founder was Emperor Taizu, or Zhu Yuanzhang. He was born into poverty and spent part of his youth wandering the country after his parents died following a series of natural disasters centered around the Yellow River. The Ming dynasty was known for its trade expansion to the outside world that established cultural ties with the West. The Ming Dynasty is also remembered for its drama, literature and world-renowned porcelain. Porcelain was one of the best-loved exports of the Ming Dynasty. It was created by grinding china-stone, mixing it with china-clay and then baking until translucent. The technique was developed during the Tang Dynasty but was perfected in the Ming era. Maintenance of the Great Wall of China was not consistent throughout the history of China, so by the time of the Ming Dynasty, it required significant repair work. The Mongols were a constant threat to the citizens of the Ming Dynasty, and the Great Wall was believed to be the most effective defense against invasion. After several clashes, the Mongols captured Emperor Zhengtong in 1449. Ming rule was partly undone by enormous fiscal problems that resulted in a calamitous collapse. Military campaigns had also become a significant drain on the empire’s purse, with efforts in Korea and Japan doing the biggest amount of damage, as well as the constant costs of defending against insurgents, particularly the Mongols. An agricultural disaster was due to the result of freezing temperatures during the Little Ice Age. A drop in average temperatures resulted in earlier freezes, shortened growing seasons and produced pitiful harvests. These circumstances lead to famine, which forced starving soldiers to desert their posts and form marauding gangs ravaging the countryside. Notable achievements of Ming China included the construction of the Forbidden City. This was the imperial residence in Beijing, a blossoming of literature and the arts, the far-flung explorations of Zheng He, and the production of the Ming porcelains.

                The Inca Empire (1400-1533) was a vast empire that flourished in the Andean region of South America from the early 15th century A.D. up until its conquest by the Spanish in the 1530s. Even after the conquest, Inca leaders continued to resist the Spaniards up until 1572, when its last city, Vilcabamba, was captured. The Incas built their empire, called Tawantinsuyu or the "Land of the Four Corners," without wheels, powerful draft animals, iron working, currency or even a writing system. The empire stretched from modern-day Argentina to southern Columbia, and was divided up into four “suyu,” which intersected at the capital, Cuzco. These suyu in turn were divided into provinces. The Inca pantheon had an array of gods that included the creator god Viracocha, sun god Inti, thunder god Illapa and earth-mother goddess Pachamama, along with others. There were also regional deities worshipped by people who the Inca conquered. The Inca gods were honored in many ways, including prayers, fasting and animal sacrifice, but the most powerful form of honor was human sacrifice. This was typically children and teenager sacrifices. Maize and meat were generally considered the elite food of the Incas and were consumed by the “maiden” and her attendants in the year before they were sacrificed. The most unusual aspect of the Inca economy was the lack of a market system and money. With only a few exceptions, there were no traders in the Inca Empire. There were no shops or markets, and therefore, there was no need for standard currency or money, and there was nowhere to spend money or purchase or trade for necessities. The Inca crafted magnificent objects from gold and silver, but their most striking examples of art were in the form of textiles. The Inca grew cotton, sheared wool and used looms to create their elaborate textiles. The finest grade of cloth was called cumpi, and was reserved for the emperor and nobility. The empire reached its peak after the conquest of Emperor Huayna Capac. At its peak, the empire included up to 12 million people and extended from the border of Ecuador and Colombia to about 50 miles south of modern Santiago, Chile. To support this empire, a system of roads stretched for almost 25,000 miles, which is about three times the diameter of the Earth. As the Spanish conquered the Inca Empire, they were impressed by what they saw. Inca cities were as large as those of Europe, but more orderly and much cleaner. Even the road and aqueduct systems in the Andes were superior to those in Europe at the time. During this time, from across the waters, the Spanish brought one of their strongest and invisible weapons with them, diseases. The Inca populations had never been exposed to these new diseases, so smallpox wiped out much of the Inca population, including Capac and the successor he had chosen.

                The Ottoman empire (1299-1923) was an empire that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of Söğüt (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Turkoman tribal leader, Osman I.  After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and with the conquest of the Balkans and in result, the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire marked the peak of its power and prosperity, as well as the highest development of its governmental, social, and economic systems. In the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East. These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government. The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated. The Ottoman participation in the war began with the combined German-Ottoman surprise attack on the Black Sea coast of the Russian Empire on 29 October 1914. Following the attack, the Russian Empire and its allies France and the British Empire, declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Religion in the Ottoman Empire included, non-Muslims, particularly Christians and Jews, which were present throughout the empire's history. The Ottoman imperial system was charactered by an intricate combination of official Muslim hegemony over non-Muslims and a wide degree of religious tolerance. While religious minorities were never equal under the law, they were granted recognition, protection, and limited freedoms under both Islamic and Ottoman tradition. Until the second half of the 15th century, the majority of Ottoman subjects were Christian. Non-Muslims remained a significant and economically influential minority. The proportion of Muslims amounted to 60% in the 1820s, gradually increasing to 69% in the 1870s and 76% in the 1890s. By 1914, less than a fifth of the empire's population was non-Muslim, which was mostly made up of Jews and Christian Greeks, Assyrians, and Armenians. The Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Slavery was a part of Ottoman society, with most slaves employed as domestic servants. Unlike systems of chattel slavery, slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, and the children of female slaves were born legally free. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908.

                The Mughal Empire (1526–1761) was an early modern Islamic empire in South Asia. For about two centuries, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, Kashmir in the north, Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan Plateau in South India. The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526 by Babur who was a chieftain warrior of Andijan. He employed military aid in the form of matchlock guns and cast cannon from the Ottoman Empire. The Mughal imperial structure is dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, until shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb which during, the empire achieved its maximum geographical extent. The empire lost significant territory to the conquests of the Maratha Empire, which was absorbed as a puppet state, and this continued during the East India Company rule in India. The empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare but also established new administrative practices and incorporated diverse ruling elites to produce an efficient rule. Relative peace was maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century and was a factor in India's economic expansion. European presence in the Indian Ocean and its increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products, created greater wealth in the Mughal courts. Akbar, the third Mughal emperor, instituted agricultural taxes which served as the base of the empire's collective wealth. These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator, were paid in the well-regulated silver currency, and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. Aurangzeb's son, Bahadur Shah I, repealed the religious policies of his father and attempted to reform the administration. However, after his death in 1712, the Mughal dynasty sank into chaos and violent feuds. In 1719, four emperors successively ascended the throne. During the reign of Muhammad Shah (1719–1748), the empire began to break up. Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs and broke away to form independent kingdoms. The Mughal Empire had a highly centralized, bureaucratic government, which was mostly instituted during the rule of the third Mughal emperor Akbar. The empire was divided into provinces (suba), each of which were headed by a provincial governor called a subadar. The structure of the central government was mirrored at the provincial level; each suba had its own bakhshi, sadr as-sudr, and finance minister that reported directly to the central government rather than the subahdar. Subas were subdivided into administrative units known as sarkars, which were further divided into groups of villages known as parganas. Mughal government in the pargana consisted of a Muslim judge and local tax collector. The Indian economy was large and prosperous under the Mughal Empire. The main base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar.

                The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was the Manchu-led last dynasty in the imperial history of China. It was proclaimed in 1636 in Manchuria (modern-day Northeast China). In orthodox Chinese historiography, the Qing dynasty was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. The multiethnic Qing empire lasted for almost three centuries and assembled the territorial base for modern China. It was the largest Chinese dynasty and in 1790 the fourth-largest empire in world history in terms of territorial size. With a population of 432 million in 1912, it was the world's most populous country at the time. His son Hong Taiji declared the Qing dynasty in 1636. As Ming control disintegrated, peasant rebels conquered Beijing in 1644, but the Ming general Wu Sangui opened the Shanhai Pass to the armies of the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels, seized the capital, and took over the government. The dynasty adapted the ideals of the tributary system in asserting superiority over peripheral countries such as Korea and Vietnam, while extending control over Tibet and Mongolia. Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643. Meanwhile, Ming government officials fought against each other, against fiscal collapse, and against a series of peasant rebellions. They were unable to capitalize on the Manchu succession dispute and the presence of a minor as emperor. In April 1644, the capital, Beijing, was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, a former minor Ming official, who established a short-lived Shun dynasty. The last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor, committed suicide when the city fell to the rebels, marking the official end of the dynasty. During the 18th century European empires gradually expanded across the world, as European states developed economies built on maritime trade, colonial extraction, and advances in technology. The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state-to-state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in nearby India and on the islands that are now Indonesia. The Qing response was to establish the Canton System in 1756, which restricted maritime trade to that city and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their governments.

                The Russian Empire (1721-1917), also known as Imperial Russia, was an empire that extended across Eurasia. The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers such as, the Swedish Empire, Poland–Lithuania, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Qing China. The Empire lasted until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution in 1917. It featured great economic, ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity. The Russian Empire functioned as an absolute monarchy until the Revolution of 1905, when a nominal semi-constitutional monarchy was established. It functioned poorly during World War I, leading to the February Revolution and the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II, after which the monarchy was abolished. In the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks seized power, leading to the Russian Civil War. The Bolsheviks executed the imperial family in 1918 and established the Soviet Union in 1922 after emerging victorious from the civil war. Peter I, also referred to as Peter the Great, played a major role in introducing the European state system into the Russian Empire. Nearly the entire population was devoted to agriculture, with only a small percentage living in towns. The class of kholops, whose status was close to that of slaves, remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter converted household kholops into house serfs. Peter's first military efforts were directed against the Ottoman Turks. His attention then turned to the north since Russia lacked a secure northern seaport. He built Russia's new capital, Saint Petersburg, on the Neva River, to replace Moscow, which had long been Russia's cultural center. This relocation expressed his intent to adopt European elements for his empire. The countryside was divided into new provinces and districts. Peter told the Senate that its mission was to collect taxes, and tax revenues tripled over the course of his reign. Meanwhile, all vestiges of local self-government were removed. Peter continued and intensified his predecessors' requirement of state service from all nobles, in the Table of Ranks. As part of Peter's reorganization, he also enacted a church reform. Peter died in 1725, leaving an unsettled succession. After a short reign by his widow, Catherine I. Catherine the Great was a German princess who married Peter III, the German heir to the Russian crown. Conservatism was the ideology of most of the Russian leadership. The structure of conservative thought was based upon anti-rationalism of the intellectuals, religiosity rooted in the Russian Orthodox Church, traditionalism rooted in the landed estates worked by serfs, and militarism rooted in the army officer corps.

            <p>The British Empire (1500s-1997) was composed of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the metropolis and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of "splendid isolation". Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognizing that it was overstretched in the Pacific and threatened at home by the Imperial German Navy, Britain formed an alliance with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies France and Russia in 1904 and 1907. Britain's declaration of war against Nazi Germany in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India. Then war was soon declared on Germany. After the Fall of France in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the German invasion of Greece on 7 April 1941. By 1981, the process of decolonization that had begun after World War 2 was largely complete. The British Parliament had the power to pass laws extending to Canada at Canadian request. Although no longer able to pass any laws that would apply as Australian Commonwealth law, the British Parliament retained the power to legislate for the individual Australian states. On 1 January 1984, Brunei, Britain's last remaining Asian protectorate, was granted independence. Independence had been delayed due to the opposition of the Sultan, who had preferred British protection. The handover ceremony in 1997 was marked for many as the end of the empire.</p>
